# ComfyUI & AUTOMATIC1111 on Modal  

This repository sets up a working environment for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI), [AUTOMATIC1111 Stable Diffusion WebUI](https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui), and [Deforum](https://github.com/deforum-art/deforum-stable-diffusion) on [modal.com](https://modal.com/).  

It includes pre-built images that handle downloading and saving various models ‚Äî including checkpoints, LoRAs, VAEs, and ControlNets ‚Äî from [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/) and [CivitAI](https://civitai.com/).  


## üöÄ Setup  

1. **Create an account** on [modal.com](https://modal.com/).  
2. **Install dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. **Set up Modal CLI:**  
   ```bash
   modal setup
   ```  
4. **Download models and assets:**  
   ```bash
   python download_data.py
   ```  
5. **Launch the WebUI:**  
   ```bash
   python comfyui.py   # For ComfyUI  
   python a1111.py     # For AUTOMATIC1111  
   ```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration  

The `config.json` file defines which models to download.  

To download models from CivitAI, include your CivitAI token in this file ‚Äî it's required for access to CivitAI models.

If you want to add other models just add them to the config file and launch `python download_data.py`.

## üíæ Modal Volumes  

The scripts use two persistent volumes:  

- **`data`**: Stores models and user inputs.  
- **`cache`**: Stores outputs and temporary files.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Scripts  

- **`download_data.py`**: Downloads models from HuggingFace and CivitAI based on `config.json`. Data is stored on a Modal volume to avoid re-downloading.  
- **`a1111.py`**: Sets up the AUTOMATIC1111 WebUI and installs the Deforum extension.  
- **`comfyui.py`**: Sets up ComfyUI with custom nodes and Deforum Comfy Nodes.
